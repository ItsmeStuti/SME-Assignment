There is a Several reasons for Bugs Error
a) incorrect file path.
b) Missing header file: I checked the GameplayController.h header file exists in the specified location or not, but still I'm not able to fix the bugs error. 
c) File permissions:  File permissions should typically allow read access.
d) Cyclic dependencies: If GameplayController.h includes other headers (e.g., GameplayController.h includes GameplayView.h, which includes GameplayController.h again).
e) Case sensitivity: Depending on the file system, filenames may be case-sensitive.

I tried everything that i mentioned above but not able to completely resolve the bugs error.
